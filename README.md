💫 About Me

I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer and Tech Enthusiast who loves turning complex problems into elegant, pixel-perfect code. When I'm not debugging or optimizing performance, you'll find me exploring new frameworks or contributing to open-source projects.

🔭 Currently working on: An AI-powered productivity dashboard.

🌱 Learning: Advanced Rust and Distributed Systems.

👯 Looking to collaborate on: Open-source Web3 or Creative Coding projects.

💬 Ask me about: React, Node.js, and why clean code matters.

⚡ Fun Fact: I can explain the 'this' keyword in JavaScript without crying (mostly).
